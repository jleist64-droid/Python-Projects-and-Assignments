Print the type of variable BYr is and the type CYr is to the output. Are they the same type? If necessary convert the type of variable so that you can take the difference between the current year and the user's birth year. Then print the following statement: \"You are approximately YY years old. Congrats on surving that long, you are doing well.\" Note, the spacing should be exact as in the example and XX will be the age of the user. "
