    "# Lab 5: Dictionaries \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will practice the use of dictionaries. Do the following tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 1: Reading a file of data**\n",
    "In the module there is a file named \"Birth_Life.txt\". You will need to download this file and put it into the same working directory you have decided to save this lab file to for easy access to the file. You should open this file and review its contents but make no changes to the file. You should see it is information about a selection of countries. Specifically, Country Name is a column that contains the country's name, followed by Life_Exp this is the average life time in years for that country, followed by Birth_Rate this is the average birthrate for that country per 1000 people in a year. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the open(\"filename\", \"r\") function read the file and store the output into a variable named f_obj (file object). \n",
    "2. now use the file_object.read() function to read all of the information, and store it in alldata variable. The .read() function will essentially read all of the data into a single line of information. \n",
    "3. Split the data using alldata.split(\"\\n\") this will split the data list based on the new line marker locations, which is at the end of each line of information in the original text. You should store the output of this into a new variable called alldata_split. \n",
    "4. This is where my help ends and the task really begins. Explore the current output that you have stored into alldata_split variable from point 3. Using a for loop, range, and split, create a list of lists, where all the data from one line is put into a list. the desired output should look like this for the first two lines: \n",
    "[['Country', 'Name', 'Life_Exp', 'Birth_Rate', 'GNI', 'Development'],\n",
    " ['\"Congo,', 'Dem.', 'Rep.\"', '50.00', '45.96', '130', 'Developing'],...]\n",
    " \n",
    "This list of lists should be named data_list. Print the output of the code meaning, print the data_list variable on to the console. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. The last thing close the file object, run this line of code at the end `f_obj.close()`."
