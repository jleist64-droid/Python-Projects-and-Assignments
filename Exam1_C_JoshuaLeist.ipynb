On the surface I like the fact that it is more thorough it its approach and you can follow along with what it is trying to accomplish. I can see that it is clearly defining which values are the first and second highest in value. Along with this, from an efficiency standpoint, it is not taking the time / resources to manually sort through the numbers. The last line and print statement also handles instances of where there is no second number in the list. Overall, I find the second implementation to be cleaner and better structured than the first, despite the fact that there are more lines of code.
